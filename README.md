### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with fluency in JavaScript (Node/Express, ReactJs and Angular, with testing in Mocha/Chai), Dart (Flutter), Version control (GIT) and Continous Integration (Travis CI)
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning DSA :'(
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fullstack projects. Currently building @RePay.Africa

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to programming, especially JavaScript, will debug your code for free if you're not delegating everything to me ie, collaborative assistance.
- ðŸ“« Follow me on <a href = "https://twitter.com/ClaudWatari">Twitter</a>, <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/claudwatari/">Instagram</a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/watari-kamau/">LinkedIn</a>.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love music as much as I love programming (Rock, Classical and Orchestra, Hip Hop, Old RnB, a little Pop and maybe some reggae as well). Looking to get to music production later.
